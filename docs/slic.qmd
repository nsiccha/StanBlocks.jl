# Features

* Stan blocks, types, dimensions and constraints are inferred for each parameter from the combination of model and data.
* Models can define default priors, which are not used when the corresponding parameter is provided.
* Models can return expressions, with the return value assigned to the lhs of a sampling statement involving that model.

## Missing features

* Prettyfication of generated code
* Control flow (loops, if-else-blocks)
* User defined functions
* Broadcasting
* More


# Case studies

The below case studies only use dummy data to generate the stan models. Some case studies are not functional yet, as in they use currently unimplemented features.
